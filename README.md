# NLP Basic 🧠

A beginner-friendly toolkit for exploring foundational Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. This repository helps you quickly understand, experiment with, and build simple NLP workflows.

---

## Overview

**NLP Basic** offers a practical collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that guide you through common NLP tasks: text preprocessing, tokenization, vectorization, and building simple models. It’s designed for learners, developers, and anyone wanting a lightweight, hands-on introduction to NLP.

---

## Motivation

- 🎓 **Learning by Doing**: Provides runnable, well-commented examples for core NLP tasks.  
- 🚀 **Kickstart Your Project**: Acts as a boilerplate for small NLP use-cases and experiments.  
- 🔍 **Experiment Friendly**: Easily modify code or datasets to test different approaches.  
- 📈 **Extensible Base**: Can evolve into more advanced NLP workflows (e.g., embeddings, transformers).
